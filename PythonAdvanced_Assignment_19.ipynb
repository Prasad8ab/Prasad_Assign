    "Q1. Define the relationship between a class and its instances. Is it a one-to-one or a one-to-many partnership, for example?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class and its instances have a one-to-many relationship. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, and each object is an instance of its class. For example, the class Dog can be used to create many different instances of dogs, each with its own unique attributes and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What kind of data is held only in an instance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance data is data that is specific to a particular instance of a class. For example, the name of a dog is an instance data because it is unique to each individual dog. Class data, on the other hand, is data that is shared by all instances of a class. For example, the breed of dog is a class data because it is the same for all dogs of that breed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What kind of knowledge is stored in a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class stores knowledge about the attributes and behavior of its instances. Attributes are the data that an instance stores, such as its name, age, and breed. Behavior is the way that an instance interacts with the world, such as how it walks, barks, and eats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What exactly is a method, and how is it different from a regular function?\n",
    "\n",
    "A method is a function that is defined inside a class. Methods are used to perform actions on instances of the class. For example, the bark() method is a method that is defined in the Dog class. This method can be used to make any dog instance bark.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between a method and a regular function is that a method can access the instance data of the class that it is defined in. For example, the bark() method can access the name attribute of the dog instance that it is called on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Is inheritance supported in Python, and if so, what is the syntax?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, inheritance is supported in Python. Inheritance allows a new class to inherit the attributes and behavior of an existing class. The syntax for inheritance is:\n",
    "\n",
    "class ChildClass(ParentClass):\n",
    "    # Child class code goes here\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this example, the ChildClass inherits from the ParentClass. This means that the ChildClass will have all of the attributes and behavior of the ParentClass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports full encapsulation. This means that you can make instance and class variables private, so that they can only be accessed by the methods of the class that they are defined in.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a variable private, you can prefix it with an underscore (_). For example:\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    _name = \"Barley\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(self._name + \" is barking!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. How do you distinguish between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Class variables are defined outside of any method, and they are shared by all instances of the class. Instance variables are defined inside of a method, and they are unique to each instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "class Dog:\n",
    "    species = \"Canis lupus familiaris\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(self.name + \" is barking!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "n this example, the species variable is a class variable. This means that it is shared by all instances of the Dog class. The name and age variables are instance variables. This means that they are unique to each instance of the Dog class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. When, if ever, can self be included in a class's method definitions?\n",
    "\n",
    "The self keyword refers to the current instance of the class. This means that it can only be used in the method definitions of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What is the difference between the _ add _ and the _ radd _ methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "The _ _add_ _ method is used to add two objects together, and the _ _radd_ _ method is used to add an object to another object. The difference between the two methods is that the _ _add_ _ method is called on the first object, while the _ _radd_ _ method is called on the second object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. When is it necessary to use a reflection method? When do you not need it, even though you support the operation in question?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection methods are used to get information about an object at runtime. This information can be used to perform operations on the object, such as calling its methods or accessing its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reflection methods are necessary when you need to perform an operation on an object that you do not know the type of at runtime. For example, if you have a function that takes an object as an argument, and you need to call a method on that object, you can use a reflection method to get the name of the method and then call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to use reflection methods if you know the type of object that you are working with. For example, if you have a function that takes a Dog object as an argument, you can call the bark() method on the object directly, without using a reflection method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What is the _ iadd _ method called?\n",
    "\n",
    "The _ _iadd_ _ method is called the in-place addition operator. It is used to add an object to another object, and it modifies the first object in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. Is the _ init _ method inherited by subclasses? What do you do if you need to customize its behavior within a subclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the _ _init_ _ method is inherited by subclasses. This means that when you create a subclass, the _ _init_ _ method of the superclass will be called automatically when you create an instance of the subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to customize the behavior of the _ _init_ _ method in a subclass, you can override the method. To do this, you need to define a method in the subclass with the same name and signature as the _ _init_ _ method in the superclass.\n"
