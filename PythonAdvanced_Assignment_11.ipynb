    "\n",
    "A metaclass is a class of a class. In other words, it is a blueprint for creating classes. Metaclasses are used to customize the behavior of classes, such as how they are created, how they inherit from other classes, and how they interact with instances."

    "Q2. What is the best way to declare a class's metaclass?\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to declare a class's metaclass is to use the metaclass keyword in the class definition. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyClass(metaclass=MyMetaclass):\n",
    "  pass\n",

    "Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Class decorators and metaclasses both allow you to customize the behavior of classes. However, they do so in different ways. Class decorators are executed before the class is created, while metaclasses are executed after the class is created. This means that class decorators can only affect the behavior of the class itself, while metaclasses can affect the behavior of the class and its instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling instances?\n",
    "\n",
    "Class decorators and metaclasses can both be used to customize the behavior of instances. However, they do so in different ways. Class decorators are executed when an instance is created, while metaclasses are executed when an instance is created and every time the instance's __init__() method is called. This means that class decorators can only affect the behavior of newly created instances, while metaclasses can affect the behavior of all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of how class decorators and metaclasses can be used to customize the behavior of classes and instances:\n",
    "\n",
    "A class decorator can be used to add a logging function to all instances of a class.\n",
    "A metaclass can be used to prevent instances of a class from being created.\n",
    "A class decorator can be used to change the way that a class's methods are called.\n",
    "A metaclass can be used to add new attributes to all instances of a class."
