    "8.Why is using logging messages better than using print() to display the same message?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "Configurability: Logging provides a more flexible and configurable way to handle messages. You can easily configure the logging level to control which messages are displayed or logged based on their severity. This allows you to toggle the verbosity of logging messages without modifying the code. With print(), you would need to manually add or remove statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logging Levels: Logging offers different levels (e.g., debug, info, warning, error, critical) that allow you to categorize and prioritize messages based on their importance and severity. It enables you to selectively enable or disable specific levels of messages during runtime for debugging or production purposes. print() statements lack this level of granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Streams: Logging allows you to direct messages to various output streams, such as the console, files, or even network sockets. This flexibility is useful for capturing and storing log information for later analysis, monitoring, or debugging, without cluttering the program's primary output. print() statements are limited to writing messages to the console or standard output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granular Control: With logging, you can configure different loggers and handlers to direct messages to different destinations or formats based on various criteria. This allows you to separate and categorize log messages based on their sources, modules, or components. print() statements lack this level of granular control.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Impact: Logging statements can be selectively enabled or disabled based on the logging level. In production environments, when debug-level messages are disabled, logging has minimal performance impact compared to print() statements, which are typically removed manually."

    "9. What are the differences between the Step Over, Step In, and Step Out buttons in the debugger?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Over: The Step Over button allows you to execute the current line of code and move to the next line in a single step. If the line contains a function call, it will execute the entire function without stepping into it, effectively \"stepping over\" the function and treating it as a single step. This is useful for quickly moving through a block of code or skipping over function calls when you're not interested in debugging their internal details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step In: The Step In button allows you to dive into the execution of a function or method call. When you encounter a function call while debugging, clicking Step In will take you inside that function, allowing you to step through each line of code within that function. This is helpful for examining the behavior and variables within the function and understanding its internal execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step Out: The Step Out button is used to quickly navigate out of the current function or method being debugged. If you are currently debugging within a function and want to return to the calling code, clicking Step Out will execute the remaining lines of the current function and return control to the line immediately after the function call. It allows you to skip over the remaining lines of the current function and focus on the higher-level code"
