    "1. How do word embeddings capture semantic meaning in text preprocessing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Word embeddings are vector representations of words that capture their semantic meaning. This is done by training a neural network on a large corpus of text, and the resulting word embeddings are able to capture the relationships between words. For example, the word embeddings for \"cat\" and \"dog\" will be similar, while the word embeddings for \"cat\" and \"table\" will be less similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain the concept of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and their role in text processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that are well-suited for processing sequential data. This is because RNNs can maintain a state that is updated as they process each new element in the sequence. This allows RNNs to capture long-term dependencies in text, which is important for tasks like machine translation and text summarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the encoder-decoder concept, and how is it applied in tasks like machine translation or text summarization?\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoder-decoder concept is a common approach to text processing tasks. In an encoder-decoder model, the encoder first converts the input text into a sequence of vectors.

    "4. Discuss the advantages of attention-based mechanisms in text processing models.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Explain the concept of self-attention mechanism and its advantages in natural language processing.\n",
