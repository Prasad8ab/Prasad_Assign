    "Q1. Explain the difference between greedy and non-greedy syntax with visual terms in as few words as possible. What is the bare minimum effort required to transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one? What characters or characters can you introduce or change?\n",
    "Q2. When exactly does greedy versus non-greedy make a difference?  What if you're looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy?\n",
    "Q3. In a simple match of a string, which looks only for one match and does not do any replacement, is the use of a nontagged group likely to make any practical difference?\n",
    "Q4. Describe a scenario in which using a nontagged category would have a significant impact on the program's outcomes.\n",
    "Q5. Unlike a normal regex pattern, a look-ahead condition does not consume the characters it examines. Describe a situation in which this could make a difference in the results of your programme.\n",
    "Q6. In standard expressions, what is the difference between positive look-ahead and negative look-ahead?\n",
    "Q7. What is the benefit of referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard expression?\n",
    "Q8. Can you identify repeated items within a target string using named groups, as in \"The cow jumped over the moon\"?\n",
    "Q9. When parsing a string, what is at least one thing that the Scanner interface does for you that the re.findall feature does not?\n",
    "Q10. Does a scanner object have to be named scanner?\n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1. Greedy and non-greedy syntax in regular expressions are used to control how many times a pattern is matched. A greedy pattern will match as many times as possible, while a non-greedy pattern will match as few times as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To transform a greedy pattern into a non-greedy one, you can add a question mark (?) after the quantifier. For example, the greedy pattern * will match as many characters as possible, while the non-greedy pattern *? will match as few characters as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Greedy versus non-greedy matching makes a difference when you want to match a specific number of times. For example, if you want to match five characters, you would use a greedy pattern like *5. However, if you want to match five characters or fewer, you would use a non-greedy pattern like *5?.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are looking for a non-greedy match but the only one available is greedy, you can use a negative lookahead assertion to match the pattern only if it is not followed by a specific sequence of characters. For example, the pattern \\d{3}(?!\\d) will match a sequence of three digits, but only if it is not followed by another digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. In a simple match of a string, which looks only for one match and does not do any replacement, the use of a nontagged group is not likely to make any practical difference. This is because the nontagged group will simply be ignored by the regular expression engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you are doing more complex operations with the regular expression, such as extracting parts of the string or replacing parts of the string, then the use of a nontagged group can make a difference. For example, if you are extracting the first word from a string, you would use a nontagged group to capture the word. This would allow you to access the word later in your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. A scenario in which using a nontagged group would have a significant impact on the program's results is when you are using the regular expression to extract a part of a string that is surrounded by other characters. For example, if you are extracting the phone number from a string, you would use a nontagged group to capture the phone number. This would allow you to ignore the characters that surround the phone number, such as spaces and dashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. A look-ahead condition is a special type of regular expression pattern that matches a sequence of characters, but does not consume those characters. This means that the look-ahead condition does not affect the rest of the regular expression pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "One situation in which a look-ahead condition could make a difference in the results of your program is when you are trying to match a pattern that is surrounded by other characters. For example, if you are trying to match the pattern abc, but you do not want to match the pattern if it is preceded by the character d, you could use the look-ahead condition (?!d).*abc. This pattern will match the pattern abc, but only if it is not preceded by the character d.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. In standard expressions, positive look-ahead matches a sequence of characters if the sequence is followed by the specified characters. Negative look-ahead matches a sequence of characters if the sequence is not followed by the specified characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the pattern (ab)?c+ will match the string abc because the sequence ab is followed by the character c. However, the pattern will not match the string ac because the sequence ab is not followed by the character c.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. There are several benefits to referring to groups by name rather than by number in a standard expression. First, it makes your regular expression more readable and maintainable. Second, it allows you to refer to groups in your program code. Third, it allows you to use the same group name in multiple regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the regular expression (?P<name>\\w+) (?P<age>\\d+) matches a sequence of one or more words followed by a sequence of one or more digits. The group names name and age can be used to refer to the matched words and digits in your program code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Yes, you can identify repeated items within a target string using named groups. For example, the regular expression (?P<word>\\w+)+\\s(?P<count>\\d+) will match a sequence of one or more words followed by a space and a sequence of one or more digits. The group names word and count can be used to refer to the matched words and digits in your program code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. The Scanner interface provides a number of features that the re.findall feature does not. For example, the Scanner interface can be used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenize a string into a sequence of tokens.\n",
    "Skip over white space characters.\n",
    "Recognize different types of tokens, such as keywords, identifiers, and literals.\n",
    "Access the properties of tokens, such as their type and value\n",
    "    \n",
    "Q10. No, a scanner object does not have to be named scanner. You can name it anything you like. For example, the following code is valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "import re\n",
    "\n",
    "def count_words(string):\n",
    "    scanner = re.Scanner()\n",
    "    matches = scanner.finditer(r\"(?P<word>\\w+)+\\s(?P<count>\\d+)\", string)\n",
    "    for match in matches:\n",
    "        print(f\"The word '{match['word']}' appears {match['count']} times.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "count_words(\"The cow jumped over the moon\")\n"
