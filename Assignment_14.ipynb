    "1. What does RGBA stand for?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "RGBA stands for Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha. It is a color model that is used to represent colors on computers. RGBA colors are composed of four channels, where each channel is represented by 8 bits. In RGBA, the red, green, and blue channels represent the color of the pixel, and the alpha channel represents the opacity of the pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The alpha channel can be used to create transparent or semi-transparent pixels. For example, an RGBA color with a red value of 255, a green value of 0, a blue value of 0, and an alpha value of 127 would be a fully opaque pixel with a red tint. An RGBA color with the same red, green, and blue values, but an alpha value of 0, would be a fully transparent pixel.\n"

    "A box tuple is a data structure in Tarantool that is used to store a set of related values. Tuples are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed once they are created. Each tuple has a fixed number of fields, and each field can contain a different type of data.\n",
