    "Float\n",

    "Faster than Decimal\n",
    "Smaller memory footprint\n",

    "Decimal\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "More precise than Float\n",
    "Can represent all rational numbers\n",
    "Less likely to lose precision when performing calculations\n",
    "Drawbacks:\n",
    "Slower than Float\n",
    "Larger memory footprint\n",
    "(2) Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') are two objects to consider. In what sense are these the same object? Are these just two ways of representing the exact same value, or do they correspond to different internal states?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are two different objects with the same value. They are just two different ways of representing the same value.\n",
    "The internal state of these two objects is the same. They both store the value 1.200 as a decimal number.\n",
    "(3) What happens if the equality of Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') is checked?\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking the equality of Decimal('1.200') and Decimal('1.2') will return True.\n",
    "This is because the two objects have the same value. Even though they are represented in different ways, they are both stored as the same decimal number internally.\n",
    "(4) Why is it preferable to start a Decimal object with a string rather than a floating-point value?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because Decimal objects are more precise than floating-point values. If you start a Decimal object with a floating-point value, there is a chance that the value will be rounded down, which can lead to errors.\n",
    "For example, the floating-point value 1.2000000000000002 is actually equal to the decimal value 1.2000000000000002, but if you start a Decimal object with the floating-point value, the value will be rounded down to 1.2.\n",
    "(5) In an arithmetic phrase, how simple is it to combine Decimal objects with integers?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is simple to combine Decimal objects with integers in an arithmetic phrase.\n",
    "Decimal objects and integers can be combined using the usual arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). The results of these operations will be Decimal objects.\n",
    "For example, the expression Decimal('1.2') + 1 will evaluate to the Decimal object 2.2.\n",
    "(6) Can Decimal objects and floating-point values be combined easily?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, Decimal objects and floating-point values can be combined easily.\n",
    "Decimal objects and floating-point values can be combined using the usual arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /). The results of these operations will be Decimal objects.\n",
    "For example, the expression Decimal('1.2') + 1.2 will evaluate to the Decimal object 2.4.\n",
    "(7) Using the Fraction class but not the Decimal class, give an example of a quantity that can be expressed with absolute precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fraction Fraction(1, 2) represents the number 0.5, which can be represented exactly as a fraction.\n",
    " (8) Describe a quantity that can be accurately expressed by the Decimal or Fraction classes but not by a floating-point value.\n",
    "* The number 1/10 is a non-terminating, non-repeating decimal, which means that it cannot be accurately represented by a floating-point value. However, it can be accurately represented by the Decimal or Fraction classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "(9) Consider the following two fraction objects: Fraction(1, 2) and Fraction(1, 2). (5, 10). Is the internal state of these two objects the same? Why do you think that is?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the internal state of these two objects is the same. They both store the same numerator and denominator, which are 1 and 2.\n",
    "The reason why the internal state of these two objects is the same is because the Fraction class is immutable. Once a Fraction object is created, its numerator and denominator cannot be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "(10) The Fraction class and the integer type (int) are not related to each other\n",
    "The Fraction class is a separate class from the int type. They do not inherit from each other, and they do not have any direct relationship."
