    "1.How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "The shutil.copy() function is used to copy a single file from the source path to the destination path. It takes two arguments: the source file path and the destination file path. If the destination file already exists, it will be replaced with the source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the shutil.copytree() function is used to copy an entire directory tree (including all files and subdirectories) from the source path to the destination path. It takes two arguments: the source directory path and the destination directory path. If the destination directory already exists, the function will raise an error unless the optional dirs_exist_ok parameter is set to True.\n",

    "The send2trash module moves files and directories to the system's trash or recycle bin, allowing for potential recovery, while the shutil module directly deletes files and directories permanently. The choice between them depends on whether you want the option to recover deleted files or if you want to permanently remove them.\n",

    "Ans:\n",
    "The equivalent method to the open() method for File objects in the ZipFile class is also called ZipFile().\n",
    "The ZipFile() method is used to create a new ZipFile object that can be used to read or write a ZIP file. It takes the path to the ZIP file as its first argument, and an optional mode parameter as its second argument. The mode parameter is used to specify the mode in which the file is opened, which can be 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'x' for exclusive creation, or 'a' for appending to an existing ZIP file"
