    "\n",
    "The key tasks involved in getting ready to work with machine learning modeling are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data collection. The first step is to collect the data that you will be using to train your model. This data can come from a variety of sources, such as surveys, customer transactions, or sensor data.\n",
    "Data preparation. Once you have collected your data, you need to prepare it for training your model. This may involve cleaning the data, removing outliers, and transforming the data into a format that your model can understand.\n",
    "Model selection. There are many different machine learning models available, so you need to select the one that is right for your data and your problem.\n",
    "Model training. Once you have selected a model, you need to train it on your data. This process involves feeding the data to the model and allowing it to learn the relationships between the features and the target variable.\n",
    "Model evaluation. Once your model has been trained, you need to evaluate its performance on a held-out dataset. This will help you to determine how well the model will generalize to new data.\n",
    "Model deployment. Once you are satisfied with the performance of your model, you can deploy it to production. This may involve making the model available as a web service or integrating it into your existing applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the different forms of data used in machine learning? Give a specific example for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main forms of data used in machine learning: numeric and categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data is data that can be represented as numbers. For example, the height of a person, the price of a product, or the number of items sold.\n",
    "Categorical data is data that can be categorized into different groups. For example, the color of a car, the type of product, or the customer's location.\n",
    "Here are some specific examples of each type of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric data: The height of a person can be represented as a number, such as 6 feet tall.\n",
    "Categorical data: The color of a car can be categorized into different groups, such as red, blue, or green.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distinguish:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Numeric vs. categorical attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Feature selection vs. dimensionality reduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Numeric attributes are attributes that can be represented as numbers. Categorical attributes are attributes that can be categorized into different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the height of a person is a numeric attribute, while the color of a car is a categorical attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of features from a dataset that are most relevant to the target variable. Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset without losing too much information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is often used to improve the performance of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction is often used to make datasets easier to work with and to improve the speed of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make quick notes on any two of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) The histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Use a scatter plot\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) PCA (Personal Computer Aid)**\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) The histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data. It is a bar graph that shows the frequency of different values in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) A scatter plot is a graphical representation of the relationship between two variables. It is a graph that shows the values of two variables plotted against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) PCA (Personal Computer Aid) is a dimensionality reduction technique that reduces the number of features in a dataset without losing too much information. It does this by finding a set of principal components that capture the most variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Why is it necessary to investigate data? Is there a discrepancy in how qualitative and quantitative data are explored?\n",
    "\n",
    "It is necessary to investigate data because it helps us to understand the data and to identify patterns and trends. This information can be used to make better decisions, to improve our understanding of the world, and to develop new products and services.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a discrepancy in how qualitative and quantitative data are explored. Qualitative data is explored using methods such as content analysis, thematic analysis, and discourse analysis. Quantitative data is explored using methods such as descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What are the various histogram shapes? What exactly are â€˜bins'?\n",
    "A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of data. It shows the frequency of data points within a specified range. The shape of a histogram can be used to identify the underlying distribution of the data. Common histogram shapes include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bell-shaped: This is the most common shape and indicates that the data is normally distributed.\n",
    "Bimodal: This shape indicates that the data has two distinct peaks. This could be due to the fact that the data is coming from two different populations or that there are two different trends in the data.\n",
    "Uniform: This shape indicates that the data is evenly distributed across the range.\n",
    "Left-skewed: This shape indicates that the data is skewed to the left. This means that there are more data points on the left side of the histogram than on the right side.\n",
    "Right-skewed: This shape indicates that the data is skewed to the right. This means that there are more data points on the right side of the histogram than on the left side.\n",
    "Bins are the intervals that are used to group the data points in a histogram. The width of the bins can be determined by the number of data points and the desired level of detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How do we deal with data outliers?\n",
    "Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as data entry errors, measurement errors, or the presence of unusual data points. Outliers can sometimes be removed from the data set, but this should only be done if they are clearly erroneous. In other cases, outliers can be treated as separate data points and analyzed separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to deal with outliers. One common approach is to winsorize the data. This involves replacing the outliers with values that are within a certain distance of the nearest non-outlier data points. Another approach is to use robust statistical methods that are less sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. What are the various central inclination measures? Why does mean vary too much from median in certain data sets?\n",
    "The central inclination measures are statistical measures that are used to describe the central tendency of a data set. The most common central inclination measures are the mean, median, and mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is the average of all the data points in a data set. The median is the middle value in a data set when the data points are arranged in ascending or descending order. The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean is sensitive to outliers, while the median is not. This is because the mean is calculated by adding up all the data points and dividing by the number of data points, while the median is calculated by finding the middle value in the data set. If there is an outlier in the data set, the mean will be pulled towards the outlier, while the median will not be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Describe how a scatter plot can be used to investigate bivariate relationships. Is it possible to find outliers using a scatter plot?\n",
    "\n",
    "A scatter plot is a graphical representation of the relationship between two variables. The variables are plotted on the x-axis and y-axis, and the points are plotted to show the relationship between the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scatter plots can be used to investigate a variety of bivariate relationships, including linear relationships, curvilinear relationships, and non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can be identified on a scatter plot by looking for points that are significantly different from the rest of the data points. Outliers can be caused by a variety of factors, such as data entry errors, measurement errors, or the presence of unusual data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Describe how cross-tabs can be used to figure out how two variables are related.\n",
    "Cross-tabs are a type of table that is used to show the relationship between two variables. The variables are listed in the rows and columns of the table, and the cells of the table show the frequency of each combination of values for the two variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-tabs can be used to investigate a variety of relationships between two variables, including linear relationships, curvilinear relationships, and non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-tabs can also be used to identify outliers. Outliers are data points that are significantly different from the rest of the data points. They can be caused by a variety of factors, such as data entry errors, measurement errors, or the presence of unusual data points."
