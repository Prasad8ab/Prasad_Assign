    "Q1. What are the benefits of the built-in array package, if any?\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in array package has a few benefits. First, it is built into Python, so you do not need to install any additional modules. Second, it is relatively simple to use. Third, it is efficient for small arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What are some of the array package's limitations?\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in array package has a few limitations. First, it does not support all of the features of NumPy arrays. Second, it is not as efficient for large arrays. Third, it does not have as many built-in functions as NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Describe the main differences between the array and numpy packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between the array and numpy packages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays are more efficient than built-in arrays for large arrays.\n",
    "NumPy arrays support a wider range of data types than built-in arrays.\n",
    "NumPy arrays have more built-in functions than built-in arrays.\n",
    "NumPy arrays can be used to perform more complex mathematical operations than built-in arrays.\n",
    "Q4. Explain the distinctions between the empty, ones, and zeros functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The empty, ones, and zeros functions all create new arrays. The empty function creates an array of the specified size and data type, but does not initialize the elements. The ones function creates an array of the specified size and data type, and initializes all of the elements to 1. The zeros function creates an array of the specified size and data type, and initializes all of the elements to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. In the fromfunction function, which is used to construct new arrays, what is the role of the callable argument?\n",
    "\n",
    "The callable argument in the fromfunction function is a function that is used to generate the values of the new array. The function must take a single argument, which is the index of the element in the array. The function should return the value that should be stored in the element at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What happens when a numpy array is combined with a single-value operand (a scalar, such as an int or a floating-point value) through addition, as in the expression A + n?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a NumPy array is combined with a single-value operand through addition, each element of the array is added to the scalar. For example, if A is a NumPy array of 10 elements, and n is an integer, then A + n will create a new array with the same shape as A, but each element will be the sum of the corresponding element in A and n.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Can array-to-scalar operations use combined operation-assign operators (such as += or =)? What is the outcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, array-to-scalar operations can use combined operation-assign operators. For example, the following code is valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = np.arange(10)\n",
    "A += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will add 1 to each element of the array A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Does a numpy array contain fixed-length strings? What happens if you allocate a longer string to one of these arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "No, NumPy arrays do not contain fixed-length strings. The length of a string in a NumPy array is determined by the number of elements in the array. If you try to allocate a string that is longer than the number of elements in the array, the string will be truncated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What happens when you combine two numpy arrays using an operation like addition (+) or multiplication (*)? What are the conditions for combining two numpy arrays?\n",
    "\n",
    "When you combine two NumPy arrays using an operation like addition (+) or multiplication (*), the arrays must have the same shape. If the arrays do not have the same shape, the operation will not be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What is the best way to use a Boolean array to mask another array?\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to use a Boolean array to mask another array is to use the where function. The where function takes two arguments: a Boolean array and an array. The where function will return a new array that contains the elements of the second array where the corresponding elements of the first array are True.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code will create a new array that contains only the even numbers from the array A:\n",
    "\n",
    "A = np.arange(10)\n",
    "mask = A % 2 == 0\n",
    "new_array = np.where(mask, A, -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will first create a Boolean array mask that contains True for even numbers and False for odd numbers. Then, it will create a new array new_array that contains the elements of the array A where the corresponding elements of the array mask are True. In this case, the new array will contain only the even numbers from the array A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What are three different ways to get the standard deviation of a wide collection of data using both standard Python and its packages? Sort the three of them by how quickly they execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three different ways to get the standard deviation of a wide collection of data using both standard Python and its packages, sorted by how quickly they execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the statistics module:\n",
    "\n",
    "import statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "std = statistics.stdev(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the numpy module:\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\n",
    "std = np.std(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the pandas module:\n",
    "\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({\n",
    "    \"data\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "})\n",
    "std = df[\"data\"].std()\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistics module is the slowest way to get the standard deviation, followed by the numpy module. The pandas module is the fastest way to get the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. What is the dimensionality of a Boolean mask-generated array?\n",
    "\n",
    "The dimensionality of a Boolean mask-generated array is the same as the dimensionality of the array that was used to create the mask. For example, if you create a Boolean mask from a 1D array, the resulting masked array will also be 1D. If you create a Boolean mask from a 2D array, the resulting masked array will also be 2D. And so on."
