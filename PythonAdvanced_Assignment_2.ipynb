    "Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and modules are both ways of structuring code in Python. A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while a module is a collection of related functions and variables. Classes are typically used to create objects that share common properties and behaviors, while modules are typically used to organize code into logical units."

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Operator overloading allows you to define how operators work with objects of your own custom classes. For example, you could define how the + operator works with objects of your MyClass class. To do this, you would define a method called __add__(self, other). This method would take two arguments: self and other. The self argument would be an instance of your MyClass class, and the other argument would be an object of any type. The __add__(self, other) method would return an object of your MyClass class.\n",
