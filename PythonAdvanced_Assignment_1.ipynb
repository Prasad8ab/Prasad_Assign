    "Q1. What is the purpose of Python's OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of Python's OOP is to make code more modular, reusable, and understandable. By encapsulating data and behavior within objects, OOP makes it easier to understand how a program works and to make changes to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Where does an inheritance search look for an attribute?\n",
    "\n",
    "When an attribute is not found in an object, the inheritance search looks for it in the object's class. If the attribute is not found in the class, the search continues up the class hierarchy until it is found or until it reaches the top of the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you distinguish between a class object and an instance object?\n",
    "\n",
    "A class object is a blueprint for creating instances. It defines the attributes and methods that all instances of the class will have. An instance object is a specific, concrete instance of a class. It has its own unique values for the attributes defined by the class, and it can call the methods defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What makes the first argument in a classâ€™s method function special?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument in a class's method function is always the instance of the class on which the method is being called. This argument is called self by convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What is the purpose of the init method?\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__ method is a special method that is called when an instance of a class is created. It is used to initialize the instance's attributes."
